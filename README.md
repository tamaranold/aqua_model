# aqua_model

As an avid board gamer, I love planning and deliberating moves. But counting points at the end is less fun. With the auqa projects I want to automate this part for the [Aqualin](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295948/aqualin) game.

In Auqalin, two players place colorful underwater animals on a common game board to end up with the largest swarms. There are 36 tokens, six animals in six differnt colors. One player is trying to place the same animals next to each other, the other is making groups in the same color. At the end someone has to count the swarmsizes. And this is where this projects begins. 

In the *auqa_model* project a image recognition model is trained to classifiy each token on the board as one of the 36 tokens. In the *aqua_win* project this algorthm is used inside an app to calculate teh scores and determine the winner.
